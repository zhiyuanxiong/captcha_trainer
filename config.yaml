# SavedSteps: A Session.run() execution is called a Epochs,
# - Used to save training progress, Default value is 100.
# ValidationSteps: Used to calculate accuracy, Default value is 100.
# TestNum: The number of samples for each test batch.
# - A test for every saved steps.
# EndAcc: Finish the training when the accuracy reaches [EndAcc*100]%.
# EndEpochs: Finish the training when the epoch is greater than the defined epoch.
